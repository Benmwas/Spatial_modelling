# This file is intended for remarks of the applicant:
# Name of applicant:

#1. Data cleaning
#Checked if data has missing values and duplicates. No missing values and duplicates were found.
#Changed the spatial objects to sf class using sf package. I prefer manipulating datasets with sf
#Reprojected the layers from Longlat to utm using st_transform(), proj4string . i.e crs = "+proj=utm +zone=37 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"
#Checked for correlation between pH and OM
#Quick visuals to see if the 2 layers overlay. 
#Data manipulation: I created to data sets from the original op spatialpointdataframe object dropping either pH or OM columns

#2.Spatial interpolation
#The first thing i did is to fit a simple linear regression model,lm() and viewed the summaries of the variables to show their statistical significance.
#For this excersise, I opted to use variogram modeling and kriging interploation
#The 2 data sets were used to plot a spatial trend variogram and fit a variogram model.This was based on the spatial correlation of the point features of the soil properties. 
#Variogram plots were first create and model parameters retrieved 

#3.Kriging
#Interpolation of point values from the fitted variogram model was conducted using Kriging. (both manual and automatic (automap package) were attemped)
#Interpolation was done on:
1.Vector file
2.Grided surface--- created a pixel grided surface, regular type, from the spatial polygonDF

#Challange of Interpolation.
#I encountered an error while conducting the interpolation both on vector and grided surface. The predicted variables were recorded as NULL. I changed the output of prediction to dataframe  and saved it in the output folder for your perusal. I suspect it's something to do with the projection. (I will look into this).  I could not create a map since the varibles were blank. 
#However, the fitting of the variograms was successfully conducted. 

#4.Spatial data storage

#The spatial pointDF was store in a geodb(postGIS) from R using rpostgis package. The db name is spatial_projects. 
#db file is po_data
#Stored under schemas>>public>>tables. The po_data has 4 columns: Id_1, pH,OM and geom. Id_1 is an additional id argurment to retrieve back to R as a spatial pointDF.
